I am a PhD student at [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it), in the [department of Statistical Sciences](https://www.stat.unipd.it/en/), working under the supervision of Prof. [Davide Risso](http://drisso.github.io).

My research focuses on developing and implementing statistical models for analyzing high-dimensional genomic data, especially in single-cell RNA sequencing. I work on statistical methods like regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and hypothesis testing, drawing from both frequentist and Bayesian approaches. I have a strong interest in computational statistics, with a focus on optimizing algorithmic efficiency and exploring GPU implementations to enhance performance and scalability.
